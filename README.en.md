## 📘 Description

This interactive MATLAB app calculates the **Darcy–Weisbach friction factor** in pipe flows based on Reynolds number and relative roughness. It is designed as an educational tool for fluid mechanics and hydraulic engineering.

---

## 🧠 Features

- Automatic detection of flow regime (laminar or turbulent)
- Friction factor calculation using analytical and empirical models (e.g., Colebrook-White)
- Inputs for diameter, velocity, viscosity, and roughness
- Intuitive and student-friendly interface

---

## 🚀 How to Install

### 🔹 Option 1: Using `.mlappinstall` file

1. Open MATLAB  
2. Drag the file `Pipes Friction Factor.mlappinstall` into the Command Window  
3. Follow the installation prompt  
4. Launch the app from the **Apps** tab

---

## 💻 Requirements

- **MATLAB R2021a or later**  
- No additional toolboxes required
